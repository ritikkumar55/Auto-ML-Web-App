## Features
 - User-friendly Interface: Intuitive web interface built with Streamlit for seamless interaction.
 - Dataset Upload: Users can upload their datasets in various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.).
 - Automated Model Selection: The application automates the process of model selection based on the dataset characteristics.
 - Model Training: Once a dataset is uploaded, users can choose target variables and initiate the model training process.
 - Model Evaluation: After training, the application provides model evaluation metrics and visualizations for performance analysis.
 - Model Deployment: Users can deploy trained models for inference directly from the web app.
## Technologies Used
 - Streamlit: Used for building the web application interface.
 - Scikit-learn: Leveraged for machine learning model training and evaluation.
 - Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing.
 - Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization within the application.
